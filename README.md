# EDA-Exploratory-Data-Analysis

EDA is going to be the approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods.

some summary statistics that we do, typically, deal with EDA looking at the **average**, the **median** , the **min**, the **max**, the **correlations** between different columns. 
Or we can look at the **visualizations** given our columns. We can look at **histograms** in order to see the distribution, the **scatter plots** to see the correlations or the relationship between two different columns, and **box plots** again, to look at that distribution and to identify outliers and many others.
